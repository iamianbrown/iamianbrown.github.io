            <div class="u-align-justify u-blog-control u-post-content u-text u-text-2 fr-view"><p><br>When I arrived at the University of Illinois, a cocktail of anxiety and excitement flooded my veins. As my mom and I crossed into Illinois in our Subaru Impreza, I realized that it was for real. I was about to become an adult, on my own, 1000 miles from home. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was about as prepared for it as a kindergartner for partial differential equations. I’ve learned a few things since those first days on campus, and I’ve made my fair share of mistakes. Here’s some advice for incoming freshmen, so maybe you won’t repeat them.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Try new things!&nbsp;</span></p><p>Up until college, our options are relatively constrained. There are many more diverse experiences available for you on a college campus than there ever were in high school. Although this is the case, many freshmen (including me when I was one) do not explore their environment when they arrive on campus. Humans love certainty—we stick to what we know. This can cause us to glom onto the first people that we are exposed to when we arrive in a new environment. This can work out, but in the long term it can leave you with friends who don’t fully share your interests or values. Even if you meet some really great people on your first day of school, why not explore and meet people from across your entire campus? The other area where it’s really important to explore when you arrive is with your classes. If you can create a unique foundation of knowledge for yourself, then you will be able to make connections other people won’t see. If you take classes in two distant fields, say Physics and Agricultural Engineering, then you will have a very unique resume and a very interesting perspective.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">2. Don’t do “what you’re supposed to do” if you don’t want to.</span></p><p>When we ship out for college, many expectations weigh on our shoulders. Those close to us want us to be successful, but their definition of success may be radically different from the direction that we want to take our lives. For example, my roommate’s parents constantly call him and tell him he needs to find an internship or a research position. What would happen if he took such a position? He’d probably be miserable since it’s not in line with his goals. The pressure to “find research” or to “find an internship” is immense, and at many schools, it’s institutionalized. In my freshman year, I had to take a class that was focused on professional development. Although I can now appreciate the good intentions of this class, professional development was the last thing on my eighteen-year-old mind. The class just made me second guess myself and the decisions I was making. Remember: many people will tell you what you need to do to “be successful.” My recommendation: don’t listen to these people unless you would like to achieve the same kind of success that they have.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Focus on learning, not on grades.</span></p><p>For most of our upbringing, we have been conditioned to do well on tests rather than to learn the material. By the time we reach college, we have gotten very good at memorizing the formulas that we need and plugging them in at the appropriate times. For STEM majors especially, this is not a sustainable strategy, since your classes will build on each other. Many of my friends who looked up answers for their homework assignments in freshman year are really struggling since they didn’t build a firm understanding of the fundamentals. Focusing on grades incentivizes us to get the homework done as quickly as possible using whatever means necessary. Although this may bolster your grades in the short term, it will render you unprepared for upper-level classes and will ultimately have a negative impact on your grades in the long term. So if grades are not the focus, how can you improve your focus on learning? Here’s the key: if you don’t understand something, it’s not because it’s too complicated or you’re too dumb, rather, it’s because you are missing a critical piece of information. By taking the extra time to answer the question, “What is preventing me from understanding this?” you will be able to eliminate gaps in your knowledge. It’s surprising how few people take this step. If you can get into the habit of doing this, after one or two semesters, you will be the person who everyone goes to for help. As Elon Musk, put it in an interview with Farnam Street, “it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e., the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, there is no “perfect way” to move through college. You have to forge our own path and figure out what works for you. This is going to be different for you than it is for me or anyone else. Experiment! The stakes are low at this point in your life—there is no better time to take risks.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
